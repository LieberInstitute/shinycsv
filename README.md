This package allows interactive explorations of CSV files, data.frame
objects stored in a Rdata file (only one data.frame stored), or other
types of table files. You can view this shiny app deployed at
[libd.shinyapps.io/shinycsv](https://libd.shinyapps.io/shinycsv/). If
you are interested in the [showcase
mode](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/display-modes.html), then check
out
[libd.shinyapps.io/shinycsv-showcase](https://libd.shinyapps.io/shinycsv-showcase/).

The vignette for this package is available at
[LieberInstitute/shinycsv](http://Lieberinstitute.github.io/shinycsv/).
